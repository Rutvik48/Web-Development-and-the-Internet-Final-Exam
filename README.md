How to create an effective resume
A resume is an essential document for finding employment. It is a summary of your accomplishments, achievements, and experience. It also gives potential employers a sense of who you are and what skills and talents you possess.

Because of the impact of the internet on employment and job searches, more and more resumes are being published in electronic format. This assignment will result in an electronic version of your resume.

Before you start coding your resume, you need to plan and structure what you are going to include. Resumes contain contact information, a description of what type of job you are looking for, a summary of your work and education experience, and other relevant information like personal interests or volunteer activities. Look at examples of resumes, and use them as a model for your own online resume. Make a list of your work experience, along with information about your educational background and achievements. 

Here are some additional resume tips from http://jobstar.org/tools/resume/yana.cfm

5 Key Concepts for Powerful, Effective Resumes
1.	Your resume is YOUR marketing tool, not a personnel document.
2.	It is about YOU the job hunter, not just about the jobs you've held.
3.	It focuses on your future, not your past.
4.	It emphasizes your accomplishments, not your past job duties or job descriptions.
5.	It documents skills you enjoy using, not skills you used just because you had to.

10 Steps in Creating a Good Resume
1.	Choose a target job (also called a "job objective"). An actual job title works best.
2.	Find out what skills, knowledge, and experience are needed to do that target job.
3.	Make a list of your 2, 3, or 4 strongest skills or abilities or knowledge that make you a good candidate for the target job.
4.	For each key skill, think of several accomplishments from your past work history that illustrate that skill.
5.	Describe each accomplishment in a simple, powerful, action statement that emphasizes the results that benefited your employer.
6.	Make a list of the primary jobs you've held, in chronological order. Include any unpaid work that fills a gap or that shows you have the skills for the job.
7.	Make a list of your training and education that's related to the new job you want.
8.	Choose a resume format that fits your situation--either chronological or functional. [Functional works best if you're changing fields; chronological works well if you're moving up in the same field.]
9.	Arrange your action statements according to the format you choose.
10.	Summarize your key points at the top of your resume.
